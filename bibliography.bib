abstract = {The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite – 2 (ICESat-2) observatory was launched on 15 September 2018 to measure ice sheet and glacier elevation change, sea ice freeboard, and enable the determination of the heights of Earth's forests. ICESat-2's laser altimeter, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) uses green (532 nm) laser light and single-photon sensitive detection to measure time of flight and subsequently surface height along each of its six beams. In this paper, we describe the major components of ATLAS, including the transmitter, the receiver and the components of the timing system. We present the major components of the ICESat-2 observatory, including the Global Positioning System, star trackers and inertial measurement unit. The ICESat-2 Level 1B data product (ATL02) provides the precise photon round-trip time of flight, among other data. The ICESat-2 Level 2A data product (ATL03) combines the photon times of flight with the observatory position and attitude to determine the geodetic location (i.e. the latitude, longitude and height) of the ground bounce point of photons detected by ATLAS. The ATL03 data product is used by higher-level (Level 3A) surface-specific data products to determine glacier and ice sheet height, sea ice freeboard, vegetation canopy height, ocean surface topography, and inland water body height.}

  author    = "Hoyer, Stephan and Hamman, Joe",
  abstract  = "xarray is an open source project and Python package that
               provides a toolkit and data structures for N-dimensional labeled
               arrays. Our approach combines an application programing
               interface (API) inspired by pandas with the Common Data Model
               for self-described scientific data. Key features of the xarray
               package include label-based indexing and arithmetic,
               interoperability with the core scientific Python packages (e.g.,
               pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), out-of-core computation on datasets
               that don't fit into memory, a wide range of serialization and
               input/output (I/O) options, and advanced multi-dimensional data
               manipulation tools such as group-by and resampling. xarray, as a
               data model and analytics toolkit, has been widely adopted in the
               geoscience community but is also used more broadly for
               multi-dimensional data analysis in physics, machine learning and
               finance.",
